# MemeScholar
MemeScholar is a gamified educational web app that blends learning with memes and interactive chat. It allows students to learn from fun, character-based mentors who explain academic concepts in short, meme-style conversations.

Each character represents a specific subject (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, English, etc.) and uses relatable, Gen Z-inspired dialogue to simplify complex topics.  
Users can take quizzes, earn Aura Points, and unlock new characters as they progress.
